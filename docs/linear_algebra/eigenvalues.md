# Eigenvalues

## Explanation:
Eigenvalues provide [valuable information about the properties of a matrix](#valuable-information-about-the-properties-of-a-matrix). They can be obtained by solving the characteristic equation of the matrix and are used to determine the significance of eigenvectors in various applications, including SVD-based dimensionality reduction.

By analyzing the eigenvalues, one can identify the dominant eigenvectors that capture the most substantial variations or patterns in the data.

In the context of SVD, eigenvalues represent the scaling factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk.

## Formula:
Given a square matrix A, an eigenvector v and its corresponding eigenvalue λ satisfy the equation:
$$AV =  \lambda V$$
### Where:
- A is the matrix.
- V is the eigenvector.
- λ is the eigenvalue.

### Valuable information about the properties of a matrix

Eigenvalues provide valuable information about the properties of a matrix by revealing important characteristics and behaviors of the matrix. They offer insights into various aspects of the matrix, such as its invertibility, rank, determinant, and the behavior of its associated linear transformations.

Here are some key properties of a matrix that eigenvalues can help determine:

* Invertibility: A square matrix is invertible (non-singular) if and only if none of its eigenvalues are zero. If any eigenvalue is zero, the matrix is singular, meaning it does not have an inverse.

* Rank: The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues. Counting the non-zero eigenvalues allows us to determine the rank of the matrix and understand its linear independence and dimensionality.

* Determinant: The determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Knowing the eigenvalues enables us to compute the determinant efficiently.

* Trace: The trace of a matrix, which is the sum of its diagonal elements, is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. This property helps identify the relationship between eigenvalues and the trace of a matrix.

* Diagonalizability: A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. Diagonalizable matrices are often easier to work with as they can be transformed into diagonal matrices using eigenvectors.

* Eigenvalue Spectrum: The set of all eigenvalues of a matrix is called its eigenvalue spectrum. Analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum provides information about the distribution and spread of the eigenvalues, which can help understand the matrix's behavior.

Eigenvalues also play a significant role in various applications beyond matrix analysis. In the context of recommender systems, for example, eigenvalues are used in Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to determine the significance of the corresponding eigenvectors and to rank the most important components during dimensionality reduction.

Overall, eigenvalues provide valuable information about the properties and behavior of a matrix. By analyzing eigenvalues, we can gain insights into the matrix's structure, relationships, and transformations, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data represented by the matrix.
