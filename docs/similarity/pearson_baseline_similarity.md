## Explanation:
The Pearson Baseline similarity calculates the correlation between two vectors,
taking into account the baseline estimates for each element. It subtracts the baseline estimates
from the actual ratings to obtain the residuals. The similarity is then calculated as the
cosine of the angle between the residual vectors. The baseline estimates represent the average
rating for each user/item, which helps adjust for the overall user/item biases.
## Formula:
$$\text{similarity} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n}((r_{xi} - b_{xi}) \cdot (r_{yi} - b_{yi}))}}{{\sqrt{{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(r_{xi} - b_{xi})^2}} \cdot \sqrt{{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(r_{yi} - b_{yi})^2}}}}$$
