## Explanation:
The Minkowski distance is a generalization of other distance metrics such as the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance. It measures the distance or dissimilarity between two vectors based on their element-wise differences raised to the power of p. The value of p determines the order of the Minkowski distance, where p = 1 corresponds to the Manhattan distance and p = 2 corresponds to the Euclidean distance.
## Formula:
$$\text{distance} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}$$
