## Explanation:
The Adjusted Cosine Similarity is a measure of similarity between two items, A and B,
based on user ratings. It takes into account the user's rating patterns and adjusts for variations
in their rating scales or biases. The formula calculates the sum of the products of the differences
between each user's rating of item A and their average rating, and the differences between each user's
rating of item B and their average rating. The numerator represents the adjusted covariance, and the
denominators represent the adjusted standard deviations. The result is a value between -1 and 1, where
higher values indicate higher similarity.
## Formula:
$$\text{AdjustedCosine}(A, B) = \frac{{\sum_{u \in U}(R_{u,A} - \overline{R}_u) \cdot (R_{u,B} - \overline{R}_u)}}{{\sqrt{\sum_{u \in U}(R_{u,A} - \overline{R}_u)^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{u \in U}(R_{u,B} - \overline{R}_u)^2}}}$$
### Where:
* `Ru,ARu,A`​ represents the rating of user uu for item A.
* `Ru,BRu,B`​ represents the rating of user uu for item B.
* `R‾uRu​ `represents the average rating of user uu across all items.
* `UU` represents the set of users who have rated both item A and item B.
