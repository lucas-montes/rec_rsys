## Explanation:
The Spearman correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is calculated based on the ranks of the values in the vectors, rather than their actual values. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates a perfect increasing monotonic relationship, -1 indicates a perfect decreasing monotonic relationship, and 0 indicates no monotonic relationship.
## Formula:
$$ \text{correlation} = 1 - \frac{{6 \sum_{i=1}^{n}(d_i)^2}}{{n(n^2 - 1)}} $$
