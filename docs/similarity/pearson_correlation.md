## Explanantion:
The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is calculated as the covariance of the two sets divided by the product of their standard deviations.
## Formula:
$$ r = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{{\sqrt{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}} \cdot \sqrt{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}}} $$
