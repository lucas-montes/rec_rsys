Formula for first quartile (Q1): Q1 = \text{median}(\text{lower half of the sorted data})
Formula for third quartile (Q3): Q3 = \text{median}(\text{upper half of the sorted data})
## Explanation:
Quartiles divide a data set into four equal parts, each containing approximately
25% of the data. The first quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the sorted data,
and the third quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the sorted data.
