## Formula:
$$ Cov(x, y) = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{{n}} $$
## Explanation:
The covariance measures the direction and magnitude of the linear relationship
between two sets of data, x and y. It calculates the sum of the products of the deviations
of each data point from their respective means, divided by the number of data points.
