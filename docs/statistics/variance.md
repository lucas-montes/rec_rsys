## Explanation:
The variance of a set of data points is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data. It measures how much the data points deviate from the mean.

## Formula:
$$ \text{{Variance}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2 $$

### Where:
* \(n\) is the number of data points.
* \(x_i\) is the \(i\)th data point.
* \(\mu\) is the mean of the data points.
