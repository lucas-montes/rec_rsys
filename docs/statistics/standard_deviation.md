## Formula:
\text{std\_deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{{n}}}

## Explanation:
The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion
in a set of data. It is calculated by first finding the deviations of each data point
from the mean, squaring the deviations, summing them up, dividing by the number of data
points, and then taking the square root. The standard deviation indicates how spread out
the data points are around the mean.
