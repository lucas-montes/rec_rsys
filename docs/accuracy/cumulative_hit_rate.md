## Explanation:
The Cumulative Hit Rate (CHR) measures the accuracy of a recommender system by calculating the ratio of correctly
predicted items to the total number of items. It is a simple evaluation metric commonly used in recommendation
systems to assess the system's ability to recommend relevant items. A higher CHR indicates a higher accuracy
in predicting the items of interest.
## Formula:
$$ \text{CHR} = \frac{{\text{Number of correctly predicted items}}}{{\text{Total number of items}}} $$
