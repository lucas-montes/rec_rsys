## Explanation:
In linear algebra, any matrix `A` can be decomposed as `A = UΣV^T`, where `U` and `V` are orthogonal matrices, and `Σ` is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of `A`.
## Formula:
The SVD is calculated using the following formula:
```katex
A = UΣV^T
```
### Where:
* `A` is the input matrix.
* `U` is the left singular vectors matrix.
* `Σ` is the singular values matrix.
* `V` is the right singular vectors matrix.
