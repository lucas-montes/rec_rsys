# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Explanation:
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric method, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. 

The basic idea behind the KNN algorithm is to classify a new data point by finding the K closest training examples (neighbors) in the feature space. The class or value of the new data point is determined by majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression) among its K nearest neighbors.

## Formula:
The KNN algorithm does not have a specific formula like other algorithms, but the general steps involved in the algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Calculate the distance between the new data point and all training examples using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance.
2. Select the K training examples with the shortest distances to the new data point.
3. For classification: Determine the class of the new data point by majority voting among its K nearest neighbors. The class with the highest count is assigned as the predicted class.
   For regression: Determine the value of the new data point by averaging the values of its K nearest neighbors.
4. Output the predicted class or value for the new data point.

### Where:
* K: Number of nearest neighbors to consider.
* Training examples: Labeled data points used to train the algorithm.
* New data point: Unlabeled data point for which the class or value needs to be predicted.
* Distance metric: A measure used to calculate the distance between data points, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.

It's important to note that the choice of K and the distance metric can significantly impact the performance of the KNN algorithm, and they should be carefully selected based on the characteristics of the data and the specific problem at hand.
