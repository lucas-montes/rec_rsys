## Explanation:
Translation-based recommendation leverages the idea that similar items should have similar vector representations. It trains item embeddings using a translation-based approach, where each item's embedding is adjusted based on positive and negative samples. The trained embeddings are then used to calculate the similarity between user and item vectors, providing personalized recommendations.
## Formula:
The similarity between two vectors, `embedding1` and `embedding2`, is calculated using the negative Euclidean distance as follows:
```math
\text{similarity}(\text{embedding1}, \text{embedding2}) = e^{-\sum_{i=1}^{n} (embedding1_i - embedding2_i)^2}
```
### Where:
* `embedding1_i`: The i-th component of `embedding1`.
* `embedding2_i`: The i-th component of `embedding2`.
* `n`: The dimensionality of the embeddings.
The training process involves updating item embeddings using gradient descent. Positive and negative embeddings are sampled, and the embeddings are adjusted to minimize the difference between positive and negative embeddings.
