/// # Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
/// Decomposes a given matrix into two non-negative matrices using NMF.
///
/// ## Parameters:
/// * `matrix`: The input matrix to be factorized.
/// * `n_components`: The number of components (columns) in the factorized matrices.
/// * `max_iter`: The maximum number of iterations for the NMF algorithm.
///
/// ## Returns:
/// * A tuple `(W, H)` representing the factorized matrices `W` and `H`.
///
/// ## Examples:
/// ```
/// ```
///
/// ## Explanation:
/// Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) factorizes a given matrix `V` into two non-negative matrices `W` and `H`.
/// It aims to find `W` and `H` such that their product approximates `V`:
///
/// ```
/// V â‰ˆ W * H
/// ```
///
/// The factorized matrix `W` consists of basis vectors, and `H` contains coefficients for these basis vectors.
///
/// ## Formula:
/// NMF aims to minimize the Frobenius norm of the difference between `V` and `W * H` by updating `W` and `H` iteratively.
///
/// The update equations for `W` and `H` can be expressed as follows:
///
/// ```katex
/// W_{ij} = W_{ij} * ((V * H^T) / (W * H * H^T))
/// H_{ij} = H_{ij} * ((W^T * V) / (W^T * W * H))
/// ```
///
/// Where:
/// * `V` is the input matrix.
/// * `W` is the factorized matrix of size `(m, n_components)`.
/// * `H` is the factorized matrix of size `(n_components, n)`.
/// * `m` is the number of rows in `V`.
/// * `n` is the number of columns in `V`.
/// * `n_components` is the number of components (columns) in `W` and `H`.
/// * `^T` denotes matrix transpose.
