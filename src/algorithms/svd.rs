/// # Singular Value Decomposition
/// The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, Σ, and V.
///
/// ## Parameters:
/// * `matrix`: The input matrix to be decomposed.
///
/// ## Returns:
/// * A tuple `(U, S, V)` containing the decomposed matrices.
///
/// ## Examples:
/// ```
/// ```
///
/// ## Explanation:
/// In linear algebra, any matrix `A` can be decomposed as `A = UΣV^T`, where `U` and `V` are orthogonal matrices, and `Σ` is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of `A`.
///
/// ## Formula:
/// The SVD is calculated using the following formula:
/// ```katex
/// A = UΣV^T
/// ```
/// ### Where:
/// * `A` is the input matrix.
/// * `U` is the left singular vectors matrix.
/// * `Σ` is the singular values matrix.
/// * `V` is the right singular vectors matrix.
