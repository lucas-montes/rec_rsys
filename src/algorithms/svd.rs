/// # Singular Value Decomposition
/// The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, Î£, and V.
///
/// ## Parameters:
/// * `matrix`: The input matrix to be decomposed.
///
/// ## Returns:
/// * A tuple `(U, S, V)` containing the decomposed matrices.
///
/// ## Examples:
/// ```
